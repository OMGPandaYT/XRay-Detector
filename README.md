# XRay-Detector
Notifies you if someone is mining abnormally!


X-Ray Detector is a GREAT plugin for your survival server!

X-Ray Detector has multiple checks in order to detect people X-Raying! So you will no longer need to spend lots of time teleporting to people and checking! Only the necessary checks will be required!

Checks:
Mine Notify - Notifies you when someone finds diamonds!
Mine Pattern - Checks if someone's mining patterns is heading straight towards diamonds!
Mine Sight - Checks if someone is using X-Ray by summoning a villager near them and seeing if they look through the walls!

NOTICE: This is a beta version and has many bugs! Please don't review showing issues, I will fix them on later updates. Current version can be used but beware of some falses!
