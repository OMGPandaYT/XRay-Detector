# XRay-Detector
Notifies you if someone is mining abnormally!


X-Ray Detector is a GREAT plugin for your survival server!

X-Ray Detector has multiple checks in order to detect people X-Raying! So you will no longer need to spend lots of time teleporting to people and checking! Only the necessary checks will be required!

NOTICE: This is a beta version and has many bugs! Please don't review showing issues, I will fix them on later updates. Current version can be used but beware of some falses!
